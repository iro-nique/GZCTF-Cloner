### Cloning Single Game

If you'd like to clone a single CTF game to the same instance:

````
python3 gzctf_cloner.py --url 'https://ctf.example.com' --token '<GZCTF_Token>'
````

The script will display games and prompt you for the game and challenges to clone.

### Cloning Specific Challenges Across All Games

If you'd like to clone specific CTF challenges across all games:

````
python3 gzctf_cloner.py --url 'https://ctf.example.com' --token '<GZCTF_Token>' --newgame
````

The script will display all available challenges and prompt you for the challenges to clone as well as for a new game name.

### Cloning Across Different GZCTF Instances

If you'd like to clone games/challenges accross different GZCTF instances:

````
# clone single ctf game
python3 gzctf_cloner.py --url 'https://ctf.example.com' --token 'GZCTF_Token-<COOKIE-1>' --dst-url 'https://ctf2.example.com' --dst-token 'GZCTF_Token-<COOKIE-2>'

# clone specific challenges accross games
python3 gzctf_cloner.py --url 'https://ctf.example.com' --token 'GZCTF_Token-<COOKIE-1>' --dst-url 'https://ctf2.example.com' --dst-token 'GZCTF_Token-<COOKIE-2>' --newgame
````

### Exporting Game as Backup

You can export a single game and its challenges onto disk:

````
python3 gzctf_cloner.py --url 'https://ctf.example.com' --token 'GZCTF_Token-<COOKIE-1>' --export
````
The script will display games and prompt you for the game and challenges to export. All data is then stored as `backup.json` alongside downloaded attachments.

### Importing Game from Backup

You can import a previously exported GZCTF game and its challenges:

````
python3 gzctf_cloner.py --url 'https://ctf.example.com' --token 'GZCTF_Token-<COOKIE-1>' --import '<PATH-TO-BACKUP-JSON'
````

The script will parse the backup JSON file and import the game as well as its challenges plus attachments onto your defined GZCTF instance.
